## Usage

All utilities are designed to work with the main Databricks SDK client that's already configured in your FastAPI application. Import the utilities you need:

```python
from databricks_utils.workspace_utils import list_workspace_files, upload_file
from databricks_utils.cluster_utils import get_cluster_status, start_cluster
from databricks_utils.sql_utils import execute_sql_query, get_tables
```

## Authentication

The utilities use the same authentication configuration as your main application:
- Personal Access Token (PAT) via `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`
- Or Databricks CLI profile via `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE`

## Error Handling

All utilities include proper error handling and logging. Check the FastAPI logs for detailed error messages when working with Databricks APIs.

## Dependencies

The utilities require the `databricks-sdk` package, which is already included in your project dependencies via `pyproject.toml`.
